# Kerbal Launch Failure
Kerbal Launch Failure is a lightweight, random launch failure mod for Kerbal Space Program.

### Current features
* Launch has a small chance (1 in 50) of failure with explosions during ascent.
* Explosion has a chance to propagate to surronding parts, varying how catastrophic the failure is.
* Tanks containing fuel are more likely to explode.

### Upcoming features
* Custom settings.
* Optional random failure of heat shield during re-entry.

### Will not implement
* Random part failures outside of launch/re-entry and repairs (check out [DangIt!](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81794) by Ippo / Coffeeman, or [Kerbal Mechanics](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85798) by Nifty255).
