# Kerbal Launch Failure
Kerbal Launch Failure is a lightweight, random launch failure mod for Kerbal Space Program.

### About
NASA requires that human-rated spacecraft have a probability of loss on ascent of no more than 1 in 500. The Kerbals of planet Kerbin think of this requirement as silly, so they have instead adopted a less strict policy of a loss on ascent of no more than 1 in 50 for their Kerbal Space Program (Kerbin is one-tenth the size of Earth, makes perfect sense to use 50...).

This mod is not meant to compete with other part failure mods (I personally enjoy using DangIt!), but to be an alternative for those that want that living on the edge feel for launches without having to worry about part failures and repairs beyond the initial launch.

### Current features
* Launch has a small chance (1 in 50) of failure with explosions during ascent.
* Explosion has a chance to propagate to surronding parts, varying how catastrophic the failure is.
* Tanks containing fuel are more likely to explode.
* Failure checks end once the spacecraft has reach space (IRL, disasters mostly happen during ascent anyways). This is to prevent frustration for longer missions, to reduce the complexity of the mod, and to lessen the CPU usage for game ticks.

### Upcoming features
* Custom settings.
* Optional random failure of heat shield during re-entry.

### Will not implement
* Random part failures outside of launch/re-entry and repairs (check out [DangIt!](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81794) by Ippo / Coffeeman, or [Kerbal Mechanics](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85798) by Nifty255).
